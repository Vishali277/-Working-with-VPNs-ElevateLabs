# VPN Setup and Concepts Report

This report documents the process of setting up the ProtonVPN client and explains the core technologies involved.

### A. Setup Steps Performed

1.  **Account Creation:** A free account was created on the ProtonVPN website.
2.  **Client Installation:** The ProtonVPN client for Windows was downloaded and installed.
3.  **Connection:** Logged into the client and used the "Quick Connect" feature to establish a secure connection to a server in the United States.
4.  **Verification:** The connection was verified through the application's status screen, which showed a **"Protected"** status, a new public IP address of **87.249.134.135**, and that the **WireGuard** protocol was in use.

### B. Key Concepts

* **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** A technology that creates a secure and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the public internet. It's designed to provide privacy and anonymity by hiding the user's real IP address and encrypting their data.
* **Encryption:** The process of converting data into a secure code to prevent unauthorized access. The VPN uses strong encryption to scramble all traffic, making it unreadable to third parties like an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
* **Tunneling Protocols:** These are the sets of rules that a VPN uses to create the secure "tunnel." The protocol used in this connection was **WireGuard**, which is a modern, high-performance protocol known for its speed and strong security.
